/* 
 In this algorithm , we should compare 1 element with another element, who would small, if we want to sort we need replce position. 
 const array = [20, 56, 90, 47, 80, 3];
 in this array , 
 at first 20 compare to other elelment, is this case 
 3 is smaller than 20. so that 3 and 20 repace thier postion and cotinue with this process.
  
 we need start 2nd loop after sorted element.
